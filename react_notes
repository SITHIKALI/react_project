To complete your AI-powered phishing detection system, you need to ensure that all the necessary components are implemented and integrated correctly. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you complete your project:

Frontend (React)
Create a new React app:

If not already done, create a new React app using create-react-app:
npx create-react-app phishing-detection-app-frontend

Design the UI:

Ensure you have a user-friendly interface for URL input and result display. You already have UrlForm and App components in UrlForm.js and App.js.

Make API calls:

Use Axios to make requests to your Node.js backend. This is already implemented in UrlForm.js.

Backend (Node.js)
Set up a new Node.js project:

If not already done, create a new Node.js project using npm init:
npm init -y

Install dependencies:
Install required packages:
npm install express mongoose @tensorflow/tfjs body-parser
npm install --save-dev nodemon

Create API endpoints:
Define API endpoints for handling URL submissions and returning results. This is already implemented in index.js and index.js.

Integrate with MongoDB:

Use Mongoose to interact with your MongoDB database. This is already implemented in Url.js and app.js.

Database (MongoDB)
Set up a new MongoDB database:

Create a new MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas or MongoDB Compass.
Define the schema:

Define the schema for storing URL data and AI model results. This is already implemented in Url.js.
Interact with the database:

Use Mongoose to perform CRUD operations. This is already implemented in index.js.
AI Model Integration
Choose an AI model:

Select a suitable AI model for phishing detection. You can use TensorFlow.js.
Integrate the AI model:

Use TensorFlow.js to integrate the AI model with your Node.js backend. This is partially implemented in aiModel.js.
Ensure you update the modelPath and implement the preprocessUrl function.

Process URL data:

Use the AI model to process URL data and predict phishing likelihood. This is already implemented in aiModel.js.

Running the Application
Start the backend server:
cd react_project/phishing-detection-app/backend
npm start

tart the frontend application:
cd react_project/phishing-detection-app/frontend
npm start
